          "I want to say thank you to everyone that has watched this show, and loved this show. Some of you came to us from The Vampire Diaries, some of you found us on your own. And both sides of that are so beautiful to me; because there are those
        of you who fell in love with these characters many years ago and wanted to follow them wherever they could go. And there are some who just tuned in and instantly connected to them and that makes me instantly proud because we really worked hard to
        tell great stories for you. And your passion and enthusiasm and total rage at me for saying the show was over means that it means a lot to you. And I appreciate that. "
